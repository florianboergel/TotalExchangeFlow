# Total Exchange Flow (TEF)
> TEF analyzes the exchange flow of an estuary in salinity and/or temperature coordinates rather than spatial coordinates since the dynamics of most estuaries are controlled by the salt distribution. 


## Installing

`pip install TotalExchangeFlow`

## How to use

`00_tef_core.ipynb` contains the TEF framework and all documentation.

Further you find different examples on how to use the TEF framework.

## Learn about TEF

The TEF analysis framework (Burchard et al., 2018; Lorenz et al., 2019; MacCready, 2011) allows a consistent calculation of the transports and salinities of an exchange flow in salinity space. The main idea of TEF is that transports of volume and salinity in and out the estuary of the same salinity partially compensate since only the net exchange changes salinity and volume of the estuary.
